"""
focusTracker.py - Remembers the last focused text-input widget.

Used by the global microphone button so that dictation knows where to
insert its transcript. We install a QApplication-wide event filter;
whenever a QLineEdit or QTextEdit gains focus, we remember it. The mic
button reads FocusTracker.last_input when the transcript is ready.

If no input has ever been focused, last_input is None and the mic
shows a friendly hint instead of failing silently.
